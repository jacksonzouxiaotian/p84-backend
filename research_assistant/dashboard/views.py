    """
    Retrieve all research planning phases for the currently authenticated user.

    This endpoint returns the list of predefined research phases in a fixed order
    and determines their completion status based on associated tasks and deadlines.

    Statuses include:
        - "Completed": All tasks within the phase are completed.
        - "NotCompleted": At least one task is incomplete.
        - "Not Completed (Deadline Approaching)": At least one task is incomplete and 
          the deadline is within 7 days.
        - "Not Completed (Overdue)": The phase's deadline has passed without completion.

    Authentication:
        - Requires a valid JWT token to identify the current user.

    Returns:
        JSON:
